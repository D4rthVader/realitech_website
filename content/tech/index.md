## Micro Services

An architectural approach to developing a single application as a suite of small individually deployable services.
The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare mininum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

From Lewis/Fowler: http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html

Properties:

The services are easy to replace.
Services are organized around capabilities, e.g. user interface front-end, recommendation, logistics, billing, etc.
Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases, hardware and software environment, depending on what fits best.
Architectures are symmetrical rather than hierarchical (producer/consumer).
Philosophy:

The services are small - fine-grained to perform a single function.
The organization culture should embrace automation of deployment and
testing. This eases the burden on management and operations.
The culture and design principles should embrace failure and faults, similar to anti-fragile systems.
The services are elastic, resilient, composable, minimal, and complete.
