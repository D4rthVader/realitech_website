A block chain is a transaction database shared by all nodes participating in a system based on or like the Bitcoin protocol.
A full copy of a currency's block chain contains every transaction ever executed in the currency. 
With this information, one can find out how much value/status belonged to each address at any point in history. 

From a financial perspective, blockchain technology keeps all transaction records permanently on disributed (thousands) of computers from various 
networks distributed around the world. Each of these computers attests to the authenticity of transactions with no single entity controlling them 
as they all run on open-source collaboration. Hence the arrival of frictionless transactions and possible disappearance of intermediaries. 

Blockchains can be used to record transactions of asset exchanges (or “value”) among owners. Transfer of assets, buying and selling of stocks and 
properties, private banking, and lending will all be disrupted. These are what blockchain FinTechs are focusing on. 2015 U.S investments in 
blockchain-focused FinTechs stood at $400 million and over $150 million in Q1 2016
