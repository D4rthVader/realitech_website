 ## Apache Phoenix
 
Apache Phoenix enables OLTP and operational analytics in Hadoop for low latency applications by combining the best of both worlds:
 
The power of standard SQL and JDBC APIs with full ACID transaction capabilities and the flexibility of late-bound, 
schema-on-read capabilities from the NoSQL world by leveraging HBase as its backing store
Apache Phoenix is fully integrated with other Hadoop products such as Spark, Hive, Pig, Flume, and Map Reduce.
